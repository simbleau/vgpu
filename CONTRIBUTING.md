# Contributing to vgpu

vgpu welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are
thinking of helping us:

## Contributions

Contributions to vgpu should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with
permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or
given feedback for changes that would be required.
All contributions should follow this format, even those from core contributors.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on
the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated
efforts from contributors on the same issue.

## Getting started

Have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/simbleau/vgpu/issues) to find tasks. Help is of course welcome with all issues filed, but
the "help wanted" ones are good places to start because they don't require a lot
of prior knowledge about the project. You may find additional annotations on labels estimating rigour.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
